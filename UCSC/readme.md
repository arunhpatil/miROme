# Visualization of BarCharts at UCSC genome browser

### Steps to connect and explore miRNAs across UCSC browser:

1. Go to [UCSC genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/) and click on tab 'Genome Browser' [URL](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=chr9%3A136670602%2D136670686&hgsid=1408295531_xs8KcE4CuO2gVbsCMG1wI3UyURKp)
2. Select `Track Hubs` under tab `My Data` 
3. Locate Hub Name `ABC of cellular microRNAome` and click `Connect` under the column Display (First column)
4. After about 3 seconds, the hub `ABC of cellular microRNAome` will be connected. You can search for microRNAs based on chromosome coordinates or by their name. 
5. Once you find the BarGraph on the UCSC track (as shown in the Supplementary Figure S13, top panel), click on the barChart and you can visualize box plot and a more detailed description of the page. 

#### Description of the data in this repository:
All the files under the directory of UCSC of this repository are created to represent the expression of human primary cellular miRNAs. To create a track hub of your own data, you could follow the instructions provided at [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html#Setup).
