# miROme
microRNAome, a large scale expression analysis of cellular miRNA in humans. 

* This repository contains files to host UCSC barChart track for easy accessibility of primary cellular microRNAOme data called `ABC of cellular microRNAome` which is a queryable user-friendly browser that shows miRNA expression track of interest. The tracks can easily be loaded at [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38)

* The data folder contains all of the the datasets and R scripts needed to reproduce the figures. These figures include Euclidean Distance, UMAP, and scatter box plots.

* The py_scripts folder contains a Python method to combine read counts and RPMs across all runs from the miRge3.0 output.

* This also hosts the UMAP clustering figures in PDF format and interactive HTML format. Furthermore, the R and python scripts used in this analysis are available for reference  

* The Processing_Tutorial takes the user through the steps implemented starting at a Sequence Read Archive query for miRNA datasets, through miRge3.0 processing and the collation of data.
