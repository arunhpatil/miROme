# miROme
microRNAome, a large scale expression analysis of cellular miRNA in human. 

* This repository contains files to host UCSC barChart track for easy accessibility of primary cellular microRNAOme data called `ABC of cellular microRNAome` which is a queryable user-friendly browser that shows miRNA expression track of interest. The tracks can easily be loaded at [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38)

* This also hosts the UMAP clustering figures in PDF format and interactive HTML format. Furthermore, the R and python scripts used in this analysis are available for reference
